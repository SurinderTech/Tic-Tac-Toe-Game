# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
Introduction
Welcome to the Tic-Tac-Toe Game! This is a classic two-player game where players take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid. The goal is to be the first to get three of your marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally). This project is built to showcase my programming skills and provide a fun, interactive experience.
